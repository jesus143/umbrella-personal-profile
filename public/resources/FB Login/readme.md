Guys kindly pm me the domain name that you are working with right now. If that needs FB Login, then you should PM me so that we will only have
one place to generate the ID and Key from facebook. I will just add you as developer to that
certain app. Make sure that your fb is verified



and everyone who needs it, here it is
there are 3 files in it. One is to generate the authentication URL (facebook-auth.php) and the other one is callback (facebook-callback.php).
The button that contains the link for fb login is in index.php
